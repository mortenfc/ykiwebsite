Hello!

Be welcome to browse my code for inspiration and headhunting.
I am a mechatronics Bachelor student looking for a company to write a Bachelor Thesis for.
This repo is a free time project that should display my interest and (hopefully) competence in technology and web development. Before starting this project I was an intern at CERN's robottic team for 6 months doing web development.
Other than that I have the basic engineering STEM competences from my 3 years of Mechatronics studies: Engineering software, embedded programming in C++ and C, physics analysis, math, electronics, mechanics.

Contact me at   mortenfjord@hotmail.com   for more information

Best regards,
Morten Fjord
