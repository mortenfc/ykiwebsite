Hello!

Be welcome to browse my code for inspiration and headhunting.
I am a mechatronics Bachelor student looking for a company to write a Bachelor Thesis for.
I have experience and interest in technology in web development as this repo should display, it is a free time project. Besides, I did web development for CERN for 6 months as an intern there.
Other than that I have the basic engineering STEM competences from my 3 years of Mechatronics studies: Engineering software, embedded programming in C++ and C, physics analysis, math, electronics, mechanics.

Best regards,
Morten Fjord
